                <ul>
                    <li>A citizen's personal property, including their designated living quarters and personal storage, is inviolable. Accessing or taking items from another citizen's storage without their express permission is considered theft.</li>
                    <li>The property of a Guild, including its workshops, stockpiles, and equipment, is for official Guild use only. Unauthorized removal of items from a Guild stockpile is considered theft from the community.</li>
                    <li>The willful destruction or defacement of another citizen's property or any community building (griefing) is a severe offense.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Resources designated as communal are to be taken in reasonable measure. Intentional hoarding to the detriment of others is forbidden.</li>
                    <li>The hoarding of tools distributed by Guild Wardens or the misrepresentation of need to acquire excess supply is a punishable offense.</li>
